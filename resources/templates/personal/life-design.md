## Flow State Triggers

### Conditions for Flow

Flow state occurs when:
1. **Clear goals**: You know exactly what to do next
2. **Immediate feedback**: You see progress in real-time
3. **Challenge/skill balance**: Task is not too easy, not too hard (stretch zone)
4. **Eliminate distractions**: Single-tasking, no interruptions

### My Flow Triggers

**Time of Day**: Early morning (6:30-9:30 AM) - peak cognitive performance

**Environment**:
- Quiet room (no noise)
- Clean desk (no clutter)
- Natural light (or 5000K task light)
- Comfortable temperature (68-72°F)

**Ritual**:
- Coffee (caffeine boost)
- 5 min meditation (clear mind)
- Review goal for session ("In next 2h, I will...")
- Put phone in other room
- Start timer

**Music**: Instrumental focus music (Brain.fm, study playlists)

**Task Type**: Creative work (writing, designing, coding, strategic thinking)

**Body State**: Rested (8h sleep), exercised (morning stretch), hydrated

### Flow Blockers (Avoid These)

- **Multitasking**: Switching between tasks destroys flow
- **Notifications**: Each interruption = 23 min to regain focus
- **Hunger/Thirst**: Physical discomfort breaks concentration
- **Unclear Goal**: "I'll work on the project" (too vague)
- **Too Easy/Hard**: Boredom or anxiety, no flow

## Energy Management

### Energy Audit

**High Energy Times**:
- **6 AM - 10 AM**: Peak cognitive (creative work, strategic thinking)
- **2 PM - 4 PM**: Second peak (learning, meetings, collaboration)

**Low Energy Times**:
- **12 PM - 1 PM**: Post-lunch dip (rest, light tasks)
- **After 8 PM**: Wind-down mode (no deep work, only leisure)

**Energy Killers**:
- Poor sleep (<7h)
- Skipping meals or junk food
- Sedentary (no movement all day)
- Social media scrolling
- Stressful conversations

### Energy Optimization Strategy

**Protect High Energy**:
- Use 6-10 AM ONLY for most important work (1-2 deep work tasks)
- No meetings before 10 AM (unless absolutely necessary)
- Never waste morning on email or admin

**Batch Low-Value Tasks**:
- Email, admin, scheduling → 12-1 PM (low energy period)
- Don't let low-value tasks bleed into high-energy time

**Strategic Breaks**:
- Walk after lunch (prevent energy crash)
- 20 min nap (recharge for afternoon block)
- Snack before energy dip (nuts, fruit, not sugar)

**Energy Sources** (Invest in these):
- **Sleep**: 7.5-8h non-negotiable, consistent bedtime
- **Exercise**: 1h/day (cardio + strength), preferably morning
- **Nutrition**: Healthy meals, avoid sugar spikes
- **Social Connection**: Quality time with loved ones (recharges emotional energy)
- **Nature**: Sunlight, outdoors, fresh air (boosts mood)

## Transition Plan: Current → Ideal

### Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Foundation Habits

**Focus**: Sleep, morning routine, evening wind-down

- [ ] **Week 1**: Establish wake-up time (5:30 AM, every day including weekends)
- [ ] **Week 2**: Morning ritual (meditation 10min, journal 30min)
- [ ] **Week 3**: Evening wind-down (no screens 1h before bed, read instead)
- [ ] **Week 4**: Environment basics (declutter office, add plants)

**Success Metric**: 80% compliance (5/7 days) = success

### Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): Deep Work Structure

**Focus**: Protect high-energy time, eliminate distractions

- [ ] **Week 5**: Block calendar (6:30-9:30 AM deep work, no meetings)
- [ ] **Week 6**: Implement Freedom app (block distractions during work)
- [ ] **Week 7**: Flow state ritual (coffee + meditation before deep work)
- [ ] **Week 8**: Email schedule (2x/day only, auto-responder active)

**Success Metric**: 3h deep work 5 days/week = success

### Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12): Work-Life Balance

**Focus**: Exercise, fun, social time

- [ ] **Week 9**: Daily exercise (gym 5x/week, 1h sessions)
- [ ] **Week 10**: Weekly fun activity (planned leisure, not passive)
- [ ] **Week 11**: Social time (family dinners 5x/week, phone away)
- [ ] **Week 12**: Weekend adventure (1x/weekend, leave house)

**Success Metric**: Exercise 5x/week + 1 adventure/week = success

### Phase 4 (Month 4+): Optimize & Refine

**Focus**: Fine-tune, adjust based on what's working

- [ ] Monthly life design reviews (what's working, what's not)
- [ ] Adjust routines based on feedback
- [ ] Experiment with new habits (if current ones plateaued)
- [ ] Track long-term metrics (balance wheel scores)

## Success Metrics

### Weekly Check (Sunday Evening)

- [ ] Did I exercise? (X/7 days) - Target: 5+
- [ ] Did I protect family time? (X/7 days) - Target: 5+
- [ ] Did I wind down before bed? (X/7 days) - Target: 5+

### Monthly Check

**Balance Wheel**: Re-score each area (1-10), track changes
- Career: [Current vs last month]
- Health: [Current vs last month]
- Relationships: [Current vs last month]
- Personal Growth: [Current vs last month]
- Finance: [Current vs last month]
- Family: [Current vs last month]
- Fun/Leisure: [Current vs last month]

**Flow State Hours**: Track hours in flow per week
- Target: 15h/week (3h/day × 5 days)

**Energy Levels** (Subjective 1-10):
- Physical energy: [Average this month]
- Mental energy: [Average this month]
- Emotional energy: [Average this month]

**Life Satisfaction** (1-10):
- Overall happiness: [Score]
- Progress toward ideal: [Score]

### Quarterly Review (Every 3 Months)

**Big Questions**:
- Am I closer to my ideal day? (Yes/No, how much closer?)
- What's working? (Keep doing)
- What's not working? (Stop or adjust)
- What new experiments to try? (Test next quarter)

**Adjust the Design**:
- Update ideal day based on learnings
- Revise environment optimization priorities
- Set new targets for next quarter

## Notes

**Important Reminders**:
- This is a design, not a rigid schedule (flexibility is key)
- Progress > perfection (80% compliance is success)
- Adjust based on feedback (iterate weekly/monthly)
- Life happens (be kind to yourself when you fall off track)

**Inspiration**:
- [Quote that motivates you]
- [Person you admire and why]
- [Vision of your best self]
